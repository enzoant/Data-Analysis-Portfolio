PROJECT PREMISES:
1. This project is based on the following database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data/data
2. The database was uploaded on a custom PostgreSQL server, made specifically for this portfolio.

Business Scenario:
The marketing team is planning on making new marketing campaigns and for that they requested some insights from the Data team.
The main questions they wanted to gather for their campaign were:
1. What are the top 3 products sold by country?
2. Which products generated the most profit by country?
3. What is the profit per country?

We'll tackle all three questions in the SQL file in this folder.

PROJECT PREMISES:
1. This project is based on the following database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data/data
2. The database was uploaded on a custom PostgreSQL server, made specifically for this portfolio.

Business Scenario:
The marketing team is planning on making new marketing campaigns and for that they requested some insights from the Data team.
The main questions they wanted to gather for their campaign were:
1. What is the income per country?
2. Which products generated the most income by country?
3. What are the top 3 products sold by country? 

We'll tackle all three questions in the SQL file in this folder.

PROJECT PREMISES:
1. This project is based on the [Kaggle database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data/data)
2. The database was uploaded on a custom PostgreSQL server, made specifically for this portfolio.

Business Scenario:
The marketing team is planning on making new marketing campaigns and for that they requested some insights from the Data team.
The main questions they wanted to gather for their campaign were:
1. What is the income per country?
2. What are the top 3 products that generated the most income by country?
3. What are the top 3 products sold by country? 

The SQL code can be found in the .SQL file in this folder.

After cleaning the dataset by correcting null values, I started generating queries to answer the questions listed by the marketing team.

1. What is the income per country? ([full .csv file](https://github.com/enzoant/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/Data-Analysis/SQL/Customer%20Segmentation/images%20and%20.csv%20files/customer%20segmentation%20table%201.csv)) 

![Here's the generated table from the query](https://github.com/enzoant/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/Data-Analysis/SQL/Customer%20Segmentation/images%20and%20.csv%20files/customer%20segmentation%20table%201%20(top%205).png?raw=true)



2. What are the top 3 products that generated the most income by country? ([full table 2.csv file](https://github.com/enzoant/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/Data-Analysis/SQL/Customer%20Segmentation/images%20and%20.csv%20files/customer%20segmentation%20table%202.csv))

3. What are the top 3 products sold by country? ([full table 3.csv file](https://github.com/enzoant/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/Data-Analysis/SQL/Customer%20Segmentation/images%20and%20.csv%20files/customer%20segmentation%20table%203.csv))
